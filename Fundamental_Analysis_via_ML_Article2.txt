cumulative excess returns (EXRET12M) on the new information component of the machine learning (ML) forecast (ML_RESD) and various known return-predicting factors and industry ﬁxed effects (three-digit SIC). EXRET12M is the difference between cumulative stock returns starting from the fourth month of the next ﬁscal year minus the cumulative risk-free rate (from the Fama and French database) over the same period. ML_RESD is the residual from the annual cross-sectional regression of the ML forecast on forecasts of the random walk (RW) model and the ﬁve extant models. The deﬁnitions of the control variables are given in Appendix 1. All independent variables are winsorized at 1% and 99% each year.

These results suggest that (i) analysts do not fully incorporate ﬁnancial statement information into their forecasts and (ii) investors can beneﬁt from the ML forecasts even if they already have access to analysts’ forecasts, as the ML forecasts contain a considerable amount incremental information beyond analyst forecasts.15 Transaction Costs and Other Implementation Considerations. In this sec- tion, we discuss the effect of transaction costs and other implementation issues. Our investment strategy is based on the ML earnings forecasts derived from annual ﬁnancial statement data and has relatively low turnover. Untabulated analyses show that for the value-weighted portfolio, the monthly portfolio turn- over is less than 30% most of the time and averages Table 6.

We sort the stocks into quintiles based on the resulting residuals for each three-digit SIC industry and report the return performance of the hedge portfolio, which takes long positions in quintiles with the most favorable new information and short positions in quintiles with the least favorable new information. Panel A reports the results for the equal-weighted portfolios. Panel B reports the results for the value-weighted hedge portfolios.

Using an aggressive estimate of the round-trip cost of 50 bps, the annualized return would be reduced by approximately 7 bps per month (¼ 50 bps / 2 � 28.5%).16 However, for retail investors who trade aggressively with market orders and buy (sell) stocks at the ask (bid) prices, the aver- age monthly return to the value-weighted strategies would drop substantially to about 20 bps, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.25. However, it is worth pointing out that simple decile-/ quintile-ranked portfolios are far from an efﬁcient way to implement a quantitative strategy. Sophisticated investors mostly utilize risk and trans- action cost models together with portfolio optimizers to construct more (risk and t cost) efﬁcient portfolios, which tend to yield much better performance (e.g., Sivaramakrishnan, Brown, and Kasturi 2018). Furthermore, investors may also be able to improve their strategy performance by using more advanced ML technology, incorporating non-accounting information, and forecasting quarterly earnings, etc. We leave these further reﬁnements to interested readers. Conclusions Our exploration of ML in the context of fundamental analysis, particularly in forecasting corporate earn- ings, yields enlightening results. ML models outstrip contemporary earnings prediction models from the literature in terms of forecast accuracy and the rich- ness of information provided. This enhanced perfor- mance of ML models is primarily due to their ability to unearth new economically signiﬁcant information from the publicly available ﬁnancial statement data. They achieve this by identifying the key predictors and capturing complex nonlinear relationships that traditional models and methodologies might overlook or be unable to process effectively.

Panel A presents the Fama–MacBeth regression of earnings changes (ECH) on the forecasted earnings changes (FECH) of both the linear and nonlinear composite forecasts, without (Model 1) and with (Model 2), controlling for the FECHs of the extant models. Panel B presents the Fama–MacBeth regression of ECH on the nonlinear component of the ML forecasts (i.e., the residual from the annual cross-sectional regression of the ML forecasts on the 60 input features) and the FECH of the ﬁtted value from the regression, without (Model 1) and with (Model 2), controlling for the FECHs of the extant mod- els. All independent variables are standardized to have a zero mean and unit variance each year. All earnings changes are scaled by the market equity at the end of three months after the end of the last ﬁscal year. The table presents the average coefﬁcients, along with the corresponding Fama–MacBeth t statistics in brackets and the average adjusted R-squares. The subscripts are omit- ted for brevity. Fundamental Analysis via Machine Learning Volume 80, Number 2 89 The new information that ML models bring to light is not merely statistically signiﬁcant; it bears consider- able economic value for investors. The residuals from ML forecasts—representing information not captured by existing models—show a robust predictive rela- tionship with future stock returns. This ﬁnding indi- cates that the market has not fully priced in the information revealed by ML models, thus allowing investors using ML-derived insights to potentially achieve superior returns. Additionally, the comparison between ML forecasts and consensus analyst forecasts reveals notewor- thy ﬁndings: (i) ML forecasts are as accurate as consensus analyst forecasts over a one-year fore- cast horizon and are signiﬁcantly more accurate than them over longer forecast horizons and (ii) ML forecasts contain signiﬁcant incremental information beyond analyst consensus forecasts even if analysts have access to all the ﬁnancial statements used in ML models (and much more), suggesting that analysts fail to fully incorporate the information in key ﬁnancial statement items into their forecasts. The overarching conclusion is that ML technology holds considerable promise in reﬁning investment decision-making processes. By more effectively extracting and utilizing value-relevant information from ﬁnancial statements, ML can play a transfor- mative role in enhancing the accuracy and efﬁcacy of earnings forecasts and, by extension, in the broader domain of ﬁnancial analysis and investment.

It suggests that historical earnings are one of the most important determinants (Monahan 2018; Gerakos and Gramacy 2013). The disaggregation of earnings provides additional information about future fundamentals and improves future earnings forecasts (Fairﬁeld, Sweeney, and Yohn 1996; Chen, Miao, and Shevlin 2015). According to the balancing model of Compustat, earnings are computed as: E ¼ SALE-COGS-XSGA-DP-XINT þ NOPI-TXT-MII. We include all the components except MII to avoid perfect multicollinearity.

XADt Advertising expense (xad) XRDt Research and development (R&D) expense (xrd) SPIt Special items (spi) XIDOt Extraordinary items and discontinued operations (xido) DVCt Common dividend (dvc) Category III: Summary and individual accounts on the balance sheet Rationale: A balance sheet summarizes the resources that have potential future economic beneﬁt and may contain incrementally useful information regarding future earnings. For example, the literature shows that the book value of equity is one of the most important drivers of future earnings (e.g., Feltham and Ohlson 1995; Li and Mohanram 2014). Furthermore, Ball et al. (2020) contend that retained earnings may measure average earning power better than the book value of equity. Finally, the balance sheet is an earnings management constraint that may affect the reversal of accruals (e.g., Baber, Kang, and Li 2011). Thus, we include the summary balance sheet accounts of AT, ACT, LCT, LT, and CEQ as well as other important individual balance sheet items: CHE, INVT, RECT, PPENT, IVO, INTAN, AP, DLC, TXP, DLTT, and RE. We again omit some summary and individual accounts to avoid perfect multicollinearity. ATt Total assets (at) ACTt Total current assets (act) LCTt Total current liabilities (lct) LTt Total liabilities (lt) CEQt Common/ordinary equity (ceq) CHEt Cash and short-term investments (che) INVTt Inventories (invt) RECTt Receivables (rect) PPENTt Property, plant, and equipment – net (ppent) IVAt Investment and advances, equity (ivaeq) þ investments and advances, other (ivao) INTANt Intangible assets (intan) APt Accounts payable (ap) DLCt Debt in current liabilities (dlc) TXPt Income taxes payable (txp) DLTTt Long-term debt (dltt) REt Retained earnings (re) Category IV: Cash ﬂow from operating activities Rationale: Cash is king. The cash ﬂow component of earnings is more persistent than the accrual component, and separating them helps predict future earnings (e.g., Sloan 1996; Call et al. 2016). Because cash ﬂow statements were not available until 1989, we only include the cash ﬂow from operating activities (CFO) and estimate it using the indirect approach with balance sheet data when it is missing.

Editor's Note Submitted 28 September 2022 Accepted 30 January 2024 by William N. Goetzmann Notes 1. For example, the law of diminishing returns predicts a nonlinear relationship between capital investment and future earnings. Prior literature has also shown that the relationship between current and future earnings is nonlinear and varies across firms (e.g., Lev 1983; Freeman and Tse 1992; Baginski et al. 1999; Chen and Zhang 2007). 2. The financial statement items include (i) earnings and their major components; (ii) other income statement items that prior studies have shown to produce long-term benefits or be associated with earnings manipulation; (iii) balance sheet accounts that are important for earnings prediction; and (iv) operating cash flows, which will be discussed in greater detail in Section 3. 3. Subsequent research finds that the RW model performs well even when compared with analyst forecasts. For example, Bradshaw et al. (2012) find that analysts’ earnings forecasts are not economically more accurate than the naïve RW forecasts, and those for longer horizons are even less accurate than the naïve RW forecasts. 4. There was also a flurry of early studies on fundamental analysis using financial ratios (see reviews by Kothari [2001] and Richardson et al. [2010]). However, most of these studies examine in-sample associations and are subject to concerns of the in-sample identification of predictive variables (p. 424 of Richardson et al. 2010).

Furthermore, these studies focus on the sample period before the 1990s. It is unclear whether their conclusions still hold in recent years. 5. We limit the input variables to the financial statement data because we are interested in the decision usefulness of fundamental analysis using financial statement information. Furthermore, we compare the ML models with the extant models, most of which also only use financial statement items (with the exception of the SO model). 6. These ML algorithms have been widely adopted in the literature. For the sake of brevity, we do not discuss the technical
