details about them. Interested readers can refer to Gu et al. (2020) for these details. We select these models rather than other more complex ones, which incorporate time-series dynamics such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or reinforcement learning because all benchmark extant models are cross-sectional. To the extent that more sophisticated models may be able to produce better forecasts and that other inputs such as industry and macroeconomic variables might contain additional information, our results should be interpreted as a lower bound that ML can attain in earnings forecasting tasks. 7. Ideally, we would like to use the point-in-time data to avoid any subsequent restatements in accounting numbers. However, we do not have access to the data. We therefore follow related studies (e.g., Hou et al. 2012; So 2013; Li and Mohanram 2014) and use the Compustat fundamental annual file. 8. For each round of training, cross-validation (CV) and prediction, we normalize all independent variables to [0,1] for the training set. We also transform the independent variables in the prediction set using the same scaler obtained from the training set. Furthermore, to alleviate the influence of outliers, we winsorize the input features (i.e., per-share accounting numbers) at the top and bottom 1% for the training sample. 9. We also conduct robustness tests and compare the forecast accuracy for earnings scaled by total assets and shares outstanding (i.e., EPS), and the inference remains the same. Furthermore, we partition the sample into subgroups based on the market cap, and the results still show that the ML forecast is significantly more accurate than the RW and extant model forecasts in all subgroups. The results are untabulated but available upon request. 10. Note that this is a test of two joint hypotheses: (i) the new information uncovered by the ML model is economically significant and (ii) the market does not fully understand the new information. This test also sheds light on the potential decision usefulness of fundamental analysis and financial information. As Fama (1965) suggests, fundamental analysis is only of value if it provides new information not yet fully priced. Thus, this analysis also sheds light on whether fundamental analysis is useful for investors. 11. It is possible that the results might not be robust if we control for a large number of other characteristics that the literature has discovered. Similarly, although we have controlled for all factors in the Fama–French database in the subsequent time- series test, the risk-adjusted returns may not be significant if we control for other additional factors that are theoretically or empirically related to the new predictor. We thank one of the referees for pointing this out. 12. The left vertical axis is for the cumulative log returns to the five quintile portfolios, while the right vertical axis is for the cumulative log return to the hedge portfolio. The two axes have different scales. It is worth pointing out that the hedge portfolio has a lower volatility than the highest quintile. The annualized volatility of the two portfolios is 9.5% and 16.3%, respectively. 13. The plots for the GBR models are similar but untabulated for the sake of brevity. 14. The nonlinear models also accommodate the interaction effects between predictors. Untabulated analyses show that the interaction effects between the following economically related pairs contribute the most to the explanatory power of the GBR model: the change in sales revenue and change in the cost of goods sold, change in short-term debts and change in total current liabilities, sales revenue and accounts payable, depreciation and amortization expense and net property, plant and equipment, and cost of goods sold and inventories. The finding that the ML models pick up the interaction between income statement items and the corresponding gross accrual items (e.g., depreciation and amortization (DA) and net PP&E, COGS and inventories) resonates remarkably well with the recent call for research by Dichev (2020) on the role of gross accruals in determining earnings quality. 15. In untabulated analyses, we find that ML forecasts are also a useful benchmark to assess the ex-ante bias in analyst forecasts. When analysts’ forecasts are substantially higher (lower) than the ML forecasts, these forecasts tend to be overly optimistic (pessimistic) than the actual earnings. Furthermore, these stocks tend to have significantly negative (positive) returns over subsequent periods. 16. The literature has yet to arrive at a consensus on the level of trading costs. While Novy-Marx and Velikov (2016) suggest that “[r]ound-trip transaction costs for typical value- weighted strategies average in excess of 50 basis points (bps),” Frazzini et al. (2018) argue that this estimate is “an order of magnitude larger than [what] our model or live costs suggest.” They suggest that for a large institutional trader, “the effective bid-ask spread across all trades averages less than 0.015% per year,” and the market impact is just under nine basis points on average for all trades completed within a day. The impact of the transaction cost would be much lower if we use Frazzini et al.’s estimate. References Apley, D. W., and J.
